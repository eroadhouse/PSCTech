Guide for deploying to dev site. Url found here: https://psctech-9ede2.web.app/


You will need node.js for easy deployment. 
If you don't have it, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
Install like this: https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/


1. Open cmd and navigate to the src directory

2. Run 'firebase login' in the cmd window. This should open a google window to authenticate.

    If this does not work, try running these two commands in that same directory first and then retry:
        npm install firebase
        npm install -g firebase-tools.

3. Run 'firebase deploy"

    If this does not work, try running 'firebase init' first, but this should not be necessary.
